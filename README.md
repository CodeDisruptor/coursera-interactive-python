# coursera-interactive-python
Code used I've written for the Coursera Interactive Python courses.

The course has been split into two parts from it's previously run which was parts one and two together in one course.
I will share the code mainly from part two since part one was also a bunch of basics, yet had interesting points I do appreciate.

All code here has to be run with CodeSkulptor. http://www.codeskulptor.org/

Copy and paste code as is into CodeSkulptor and click on the play icon to run it.

If you are currently participating in the course online be fair and not use this code in your project, otherwise the course
is of no use and beside, no one likes cheaters.
