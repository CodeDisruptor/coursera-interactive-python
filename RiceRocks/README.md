# Part 2 Final Game: RiceRocks
RiceRocks/Asteroids was the final project with the Interactive Python from Rice University on Coursera.

The images and sounds as well as a skeleton template was given as a baseline. It was my assignment to give it full
functionality and make a working game out of it.

There is still room for improvement but I have completed with the project.
